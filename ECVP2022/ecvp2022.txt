Visual foraging is a paradigm in which participants must find multiple targets among distracters. Previous work (Kristj√°nsson, et al, 2014, PloS One) has shown that when search is hard participants tend to select targets in runs of one type, then another. We have recently developed a generative model that requires only four parameters yet can fully account for human behaviour at the summary statistics level (Clarke, Hunt & Hughes, 2022, PloS Comp. Bio). Here, we investigate how well the model can predict which specific target will be selected during a trial. We find that our model is on average fairly accurate, although there is considerable variation in how predictable different participants are (range: [43%-69%]; chance = 11%) and that the feature foraging is easier to predict than conjunction (67% compared to 59%). These differences appear to be driven by differences in the weighting put on proximity between different participants and conditions. Finally, in order to improve our model's predictions, we model how likely different items are to be selected as the first item in a trial. We find a bimodal distribution in which most participants start in the top left corner, but a subset favour initiating their search from the centre of the display. Overall, we find that our model does a good job of accounting for behaviour in visual foraging tasks, and we demonstrate how we can learn more about human behaviour by investigating the cases where models fail to match the empirical data.
